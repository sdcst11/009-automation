"""
Example of how using epoch time and a list can be used 
to have multiple alarms.  Multiple events will be stored
in a list, and the script will repeatedly check all of the
items in the list to see if the target time has been reached.

Note: To shorten the use of the time module, we can import
it using a different name.
